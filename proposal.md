## Description
This final project is going to be a video game made using Python and Pygame that will allow the player to fight enemies. 
I want this project to be an exercise in game design and coding skills using Python and to push what I've learned into a field relevant to me.

## Features
-Feature 1
    Drawn game window with graphics
-Feature 2
    Player controlled character that can move and jump within boundaries
-Feature 3
    Combat with enemies that includes damaging projectiles

## Challenges
I need to further learn Pygame and it's implementation for a game sequence that requires player input.
I will also need to create some graphics for the game so the player can discern the space and enemies within the space.
I have to utilize game design to make an enjoyable experience.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
    A full game where the player can shoot an enemy in a 2D gamespace and win the game.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
    A 2D gamespace where a player character can move and jump.    

## Milestones
Week 1:
Create a Python program that uses Pygame and shows a gamespace.
Create a player character represented in the game window that can move.

Week 2:
The player character can jump.
The game has collision and platforms to set up the level.

Week 3:
There are enemies on the screen that damage the player when touched.
The player can shoot bullets that damage enemies.

Week 4(Final):
Final graphical touches added.
Win condition added.
