## Description: 
Clown Saw is a 2D platformer where the player must shoot saws to defeat enemies. The player can move around the arena, jump, and shoot to engage with the enemies. On the first level there are three enemies that shoot their own saw blades to defeat the player. The player has a health bar and dies after a few hits from enemy projectiles or by touching enemies. Enemies take multiple shots to die and the player must use strategy to defeat them. The project has potential to have more levels and enemies if I had more time.
